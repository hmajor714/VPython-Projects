# VPython-Projects
By Hunter Major


## Introduction

These are some of my favorite projects that I worked on in Vpython,  primarily for my Computational Physics class.This class taught me a lot about implementing realistic physics  models into my code. The testbook we used for this class was, “Computational Modeling and Visualization of Physical Systems with Python By J. Wang”.


### 1. Breakout Game

This project's goal is to simulate the classic breakout game. This was our first time working with collision detections and our first project of the semester.

###  2. Cube Collisions

This was the final project I worked on this semester where I wanted to model a falling cube with collisions with rotational motion.

### 3. Elevator Simulation

This project was actually for my Software Engineering class final, but I used Vpython because of what I was able to learn in physics. This is a realistic elevator simulation model for Congdon Hall at highpoint. 

### 4. Tank Wars

This project is a tank war game, where you can adjust your tank's cannon to shoot the missle at different angles and speeds at the target.
